-- Sqlite only support 5 actual data types (INTEGER, TEXT, BLOB, REAL and NUMERIC). Other common
-- sql types such as VARCHAR, FLOAT and DATE are aliased to these. Consequently the following
-- table definitions use the primitives available rather than the types that would otherwise be 
-- used in a more rich sql engine. See https://www.sqlite.org/draft/datatype3.html for more info.
